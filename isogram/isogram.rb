# An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.
#
# Examples of isograms:
#
# - lumberjacks
# - background
# - downstream
# - six-year-old
#
# The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
